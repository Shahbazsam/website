This is a webdevelopment project for higher IT school (NATIONAL RESEARCH TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY)
We are a group of two people(MD SHAHBAZ AND SAMBHAV BAJAJ).

There's some implementation of algorithms in this project.
1- first one is the A* Algorithm implementation.
2- second one is the K-means clusterization algorithm .
3- Third one is the genetic algorithm implementation.
4- Fourth one is the Ant algorithim implemention.

NOTE- There's two more algorithm is left which needs to be implemented .
(WE ARE WORKING ON IT .)

Programming languages used are(HTML , CSS and JAVASCRIPT ).
All of the algorithms are integrated together into website .
